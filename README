            Rcs::Parser - Parse and analyze RCS files - vVERSIONTAG

================================================================================
SYNOPSIS
================================================================================

    A basic RCS parser. This file does not rely upon any external utilities
    to parse RCS files. Currently it functions with RCS files generated by
    GNU CVS and as documented by the rcsfile(5) man page.

KNOWN ISSUES
================================================================================

    Beta Code:

    This code is beta. It has yet to fully understand binary formats stored
    in RCS and will treat them as text. Consquently, you'll see warnings.
    That being said, there shouldn't be any large scale bugs that will cause
    segfaulting or crashing. Only warnings.

    The RCS file format:

    There is an astounding lack of good documentation of the RCS format.
    About the only thing that can be found is the rcsfile(5) man page. The
    layout is mostly reverse engineered in this module. I have yet to have
    the time, or the skill and patience to disassemble the RCS portions of
    the code for GNU CVS.

ERATTA
================================================================================

      Q: Why 'Rcs' and not 'RCS'

      A: Because the any directory named 'RCS' is usually ignored by most 
         versioning software and some developer tools.
